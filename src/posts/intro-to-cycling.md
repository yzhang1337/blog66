# Things to consider

* What kind of cycling should do you want to do? Long distance? Short and punchy? Big climbs? Nature or trails? Commuting only? **All of the above?**
* How comfortable do you feel riding with traffic?
* Learn how to change a tube! You will get flats, and will be left at the side of the road!

# Quick and cheap but impactful things to get

## Bib shorts

Gotta protect those perineal vasculature and nerve bundles! Every now and then you will hit an unsuspected pothole and you'll sustain a little bit of blow down there. Bib shorts with padding makes all the difference! [Rapha](rapha.cc) is a great place to start -- I know that they are expensive, but honestly I'd rather have one good pair of bib shorts than 3 eh shorts.

### Less essential and might take some time, but in the same vein... Comfortable Saddle

Saddles, or bike seats, come in all shapes and sizes (some of which even have cut outs for a "perineal channel"). Finding a comfortable might take time, but one that I like and recommend is the [Specialized Power saddle](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/equipment/bike-components/saddles/c/saddles).

## Get Strava

[Strava](Strava.com) is a cool fitness tracking app to track your speed, distance, etc.. but most importantly, help you both find and compare times on segments. ;)

## Clipless pedals

Kind of a weird misnomer as you actually **clip** into these pedals to then have your foot fixed into the pedal. This is not as big of an investment as it seems (since you do have to purchase a pair of cycling shoes and new pedals) but it is more of a personal commitment. Clipless pedals are pretty much better in every way you could want out of a pedal except for a single drawback -- overall convenience, since if this bike is a commuter bike it will be hard to have your cycling shoes on you at all times. 

You could compromise, however, with flat mountain bike pedals that are flat, so you have a platform to push on with normal shoes, but also have a "clipless" portion in the middle.

# Fall/Winter/Early Spring Colder Riding

This obviously depends a lot on how much you realistically think you anticipate riding in actually *cold* temperatures, but being prepared to go out at moments notice for this cold mornings or cooler evenings on those last days of "summer" or those early hopeful days of "spring," will give you back a lot more potential nice ride days!

## Apparel

### Gloves

### Rain Shoe Covers

### Rain Jacket

### Gillet


## Other stuff

### Ass Saver

## Last but not least...
### **Saddle bag**

Bag that goes underneath your seat to carry the following:

- Tube
- CO2 canister OR mini-air pump
- Tire levers (2)
- Bike multi-tool
- Emergency cash
- Energy gel (emergency)
- And whatever else you want to fit in there...
